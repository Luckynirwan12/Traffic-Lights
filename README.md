# ðŸš¦ Traffic Light Simulation using Arduino
This project simulates a traffic light system using an Arduino UNO and three LEDs (red, yellow, green). Each LED represents one of the standard traffic signals, and the Arduino controls the sequence using delays.

## ðŸ”§ Components Used:
- Arduino UNO

- Breadboard

- 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)

- 3 Ã— 220Î© Resistors

- Jumper wires

## ðŸ”Œ Circuit Description:
- Red LED â†’ Digital Pin 13

- Yellow LED â†’ Digital Pin 12

- Green LED â†’ Digital Pin 11
Each LED is connected in series with a 220Î© resistor to limit the current. All cathodes are connected to GND.

## ðŸ’¡ Working Principle:
The Arduino turns on the LEDs in the following sequence to simulate a traffic light:

1. Red ON â€“ Stop

2.Red OFF, Yellow ON â€“ Get Ready

3. Yellow OFF, Green ON â€“ Go

4. Repeats in a loop

## ðŸ§¾ Arduino Code File:
The sketch controlling the traffic light simulation is available in the file:

ðŸ“‚ `Traffic_Light.ino`
